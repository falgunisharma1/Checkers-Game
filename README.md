<h1>Project-1: Checkers Mania </h1>

Game logic:

There are three important checker move rules:

1. Checkers can only move diagonally on dark squares.
2. At the start of the game, checkers can only move forward, meaning toward the opposite player’s side.
3. Checkers may move up and down when they become “kings” by reaching the last row of the opposite side.
4. Remove your opponent’s checkers from the board by jumping them if your checker is diagonal to your opponent’s and there is an empty dark space to hop to.
5. Jump the checker by moving your piece straight over theirs and landing on the empty dark space. 
6. Double Jump will be available in the Version2.
7. Winning Logic: Whoever captures all their opponents’ checkers wins.
means one has to be 0 to win the
