Game logic:

There are three important checker move rules:

1. Checkers can only move diagonally on dark squares.
2. At the start of the game, checkers can only move forward, meaning toward the opposite player’s side.
3. Checkers may move up and down when they become “kings” by reaching the last row of the opposite side.
4. Remove your opponent’s checkers from the board by jumping them if your checker is diagonal to your opponent’s and there is an empty dark space to hop to.
5. Jump the checker by moving your piece straight over theirs and landing on the empty dark space. 
6. If the space you land on after jumping your opponent’s checker puts you in position to jump another of their checkers, you can make a **“double jump”** in one move. A double jump is when two jumps are made consecutively within a single turn. 
7. Winning Logic: Whoever captures all their opponents’ checkers wins.
